 AWS-EB organizes python code under: /opt/python/
# current app is available under /opt/python/current/app (/opt/python/current is a link to /opt/python/bundle/${bundle_version}/)
# AWS-EB makes use of virtualenv and its location is: /opt/python/run/venv
# If you want to use a python shell with all the environment variable you are expecting you have to:
#    source /opt/python/run/venv/bin/activate  ---activates the virtual environ
#    source /opt/python/current/env   --loads up all the environment variables you did define via eb settings
